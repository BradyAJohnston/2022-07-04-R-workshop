The lessons below were designed for those interested\nin working with ecology data in R.\n\nThis is an introduction to R designed for participants with no\nprogramming experience. These lessons can be taught in a day (\\~ 6\nhours). They start with some basic information about R syntax, the\nRStudio interface, and move through how to import CSV files, the\nstructure of data frames, how to deal with factors, how to add/remove\nrows and columns, how to calculate summary statistics from a data frame,\nand a brief introduction to plotting. The last lesson demonstrates how\nto work with databases directly from R.\n\nThis lesson assumes no prior knowledge of R or RStudio and no\nprogramming experience.\n\n## Workshop\n\n1.  [Before we start](before-we-start.Rmd)\n2.  [Introduction to R](01-intro-to-r.Rmd)\n3.  [Starting with data](02-starting-with-data.Rmd)\n4.  [Manipulating, analyzing and exporting data with\n    **`tidyverse`**](03-dplyr.html)\n5.  [Data visualization with\n    **`ggplot2`**](04-visualization-ggplot2.html)\n\n## Preparations\n\nData Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, and to follow this lesson\nlearners must have R and RStudio installed on their computers. They also\nneed to be able to install a number of R packages, create directories,\nand download files.\n\nTo avoid troubleshooting during the lesson, learners should follow the\ninstruction below to download and install everything beforehand. If they\nare using their own computers this should be no problem, but if the\ncomputer is managed by their organization's IT department they might\nneed help from an IT administrator.\n\n### Install R and RStudio\n\nR and RStudio are two separate pieces of software:\n\n-   **R** is a programming language that is especially powerful for data\n    exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis\n-   **RStudio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) that\n    makes using R easier. In this course we use RStudio to interact with\n    R.  \n\nIf you don't already have R and RStudio installed, follow the\ninstructions for your operating system below. You have to install R\nbefore you install RStudio.\n\n#### Windows\n\n-   Download R from the [CRAN\n    website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).\n-   Run the `.exe` file that was just downloaded\n-   Go to the [RStudio download\n    page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)\n-   Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows\n    Vista/7/8/10** (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)\n-   Double click the file to install it\n-   Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you\n    don't get any error messages.\n\n::: callout-warning\n## UWA Laptop Users\n\nIf you are using a UWA provided laptop, the 'Documents' folder (where R\n/ RStudio normally stores files) will be a network-mapped drive. This\nwill cause the installation and use of R packages to be *VERY VERY\nSLOW*.\n\n#### Solution:\n\nYou will need to create a folder for installing packages that will be\nkept only on your local machine, potentially just the desktop or another\n*non-network* folder.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` r\nC:\\Users\\bradyjohnston\\Desktop\\R\\win-library\n```\n\nor\n\n``` r\nC:\\Users\\bradyjohnston\\R\\win-library\n```\n\nThen create a file called `.Renviron` in your home directory, for me it\nwould be:\n\n``` r\nC:\\Users\\bradyjohnston\\\n```\n\nInside of this file, include a single line that specifies the folder you\ncreated where you wish to install your packages:\n\n``` r\nR_LIBS_USER=C:\\Users\\bradyjohnston\\Desktop\\R\\win-library\n```\n\nThis should enable quick install of packages.\n:::\n\n##### MacOS\n\n-   Download R from the [CRAN\n    website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).\n-   Select the `.pkg` file for the latest R version\n-   Double click on the downloaded file to install R\n-   It is also a good idea to install\n    [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) (needed by some packages)\n-   Go to the [RStudio download\n    page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)\n-   Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+\n    (64-bit)** (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)\n-   Double click the file to install RStudio\n-   Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you\n    don't get any error messages.\n\n##### Linux\n\n-   Follow the instructions for your distribution from\n    [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux), they provide\n    information to get the most recent version of R for common\n    distributions. For most distributions, you could use your package\n    manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install r-base`,\n    and for Fedora `sudo yum install R`), but we don't recommend this\n    approach as the versions provided by this are usually out of date.\n    In any case, make sure you have at least R 3.3.1.\n-   Go to the [RStudio download\n    page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)\n-   Under *Installers* select the version that matches your\n    distribution, and install it with your preferred method (e.g., with\n    Debian/Ubuntu `sudo dpkg -i   rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb` at the\n    terminal).\n-   Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you\n    don't get any error messages.\n\n### Update R and RStudio\n\nIf you already have R and RStudio installed, first check if your R\nversion is up to date:\n\n-   When you open RStudio your R version will be printed in the console\n    on the bottom left. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()` into\n    the console. If your R version is 4.0.0 or later, you don't need to\n    update R for this lesson. If your version of R is older than that,\n    download and install the latest version of R from the R project\n    website [for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/),\n    [for MacOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/), or [for\n    Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/)\n-   It is not necessary to remove old versions of R from your system,\n    but if you wish to do so you can check [How do I uninstall\n    R?](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f)\n-   Note: The changes introduced by new R versions are usually\n    backwards-compatible. That is, your old code should still work after\n    updating your R version. However, if breaking changes happen, it is\n    useful to know that you can have multiple versions of R installed in\n    parallel and that you can switch between them in RStudio by going to\n    `Tools > Global Options > General > Basic`.\n-   After installing a new version of R, you will have to reinstall all\n    your packages with the new version. For Windows, there is a package\n    called `installr` that can help you with upgrading your R version\n    and migrate your package library.\n\nTo update RStudio to the latest version, open RStudio and click on\n`Help > Check for Updates`. If a new version is available follow the\ninstruction on screen. By default, RStudio will also automatically\nnotify you of new versions every once in a while.\n\n### Install required R packages\n\nDuring the course we will need a number of R packages. Packages contain\nuseful R code written by other people. We will use the packages\n`tidyverse`, `hexbin`, `patchwork`, and `RSQLite`.\n\nTo try to install these packages, open RStudio and copy and paste the\nfollowing command into the console window (look for a blinking cursor on\nthe bottom left), then press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> (Windows and Linux) or\n<kbd>Return</kbd> (MacOS) to execute the command.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"hexbin\", \"patchwork\", \"RSQLite\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nAlternatively, you can install the packages using RStudio's graphical\nuser interface by going to `Tools > Install Packages` and typing the\nnames of the packages separated by a comma.\n\nR tries to download and install the packages on your machine. When the\ninstallation has finished, you can try to load the packages by pasting\nthe following code into the console:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hexbin)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(RSQLite)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you do not see an error like `there is no package called ‘...’` you\nare good to go!\n\n### Updating R packages\n\nGenerally, it is recommended to keep your R version and all packages up\nto date, because new versions bring improvements and important bugfixes.\nTo update the packages that you have installed, click `Update` in the\n`Packages` tab in the bottom right panel of RStudio, or go to\n`Tools > Check for Package Updates...`.\n\nSometimes, package updates introduce changes that break your old code,\nwhich can be very frustrating. To avoid this problem, you can use a\npackage called `renv`. It locks the package versions you have used for a\ngiven project and makes it straightforward to reinstall those exact\npackage version in a new environment, for example after updating your R\nversion or on another computer. However, the details are outside of the\nscope of this lesson.\n\n### Download the data\n\nWe will download the data directly from R during the lessons. However,\nif you are expecting problems with the network, it may be better to\ndownload the data beforehand and store it on your machine.\n\nThe data files for the lesson can be downloaded manually here:\n<https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314459>\n\n## Contributors\n\nThe list of contributors to this lesson is available\n[here](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/CITATION).\n\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align: right; font-size: small;\">Page built on: 📆 2022-06-29 ‒ 🕢 15:36:43</p>\n",
